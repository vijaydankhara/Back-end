JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, 
and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as 
the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the Zdevelopment
 of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.

 Client-side:

  It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document
  Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application
   to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse 
   clicks, form input, and page navigation.Useful libraries for the 
  client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.

  Server-side:
   It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
   For if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a 
   database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another 
   of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework 
   which is the most famous these days is node.js.
